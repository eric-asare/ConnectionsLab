## Production
   * ### The Plan
   I will be launching the site in two phases. Initially, I will roll out the quick-mood-boosters and make-your-own features, then later I will implement the find-your-inspiration feature.

   * ### The WireFrames
         I went through multiple design phases and sketches of the webpage :  Initial Design, Updated Design with User Journey, Layout Sketches.
         
        <table>
        <tr>
        <th> Initial Design </th>
        <th> Updated Design with User Journey </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>

       ![Initial Design](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/projectOne/design/inspire!.png)

        </td>
        <td>

        ![Updated Design with User Journey](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/projectOne/design/userJourney.png)

        </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
