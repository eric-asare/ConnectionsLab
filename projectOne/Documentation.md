## Production
   * ### The Plan
   I will be launching the site in two phases. Initially, I will roll out the quick-mood-boosters and make-your-own features, then later I will implement the find-your-inspiration feature.

   * ### The WireFrames
         I went through multiple design phases and sketches of the webpage :  Initial Design, Updated Design with User Journey, Layout Sketches.

        <table>
        <tr>
        <th> Initial Design </th>
        <th> Updated Design with User Journey </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>

       ![Initial Design](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/projectOne/design/inspire!.png)

        </td>
        <td>

        ![Updated Design with User Journey](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/projectOne/design/userJourney.png)

        </td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        **Layout Sketches**

   * ### The Steps 
      * Create Landing Page 
         * Transform Wireframe to webpage - HTML
         * Style Homepage - CSS
         * Quick-Mood-Booster Feature - JS (API and Data)
         * Create & Info Buttons - JS

      * Implement make-your-own feature
         * Transform Wireframe to webpage - HTML
         * Style page - CSS
         * Taking user's quote & font color- JS
         * Choosing background - JS
         * Create button to transform quote and selected background into graphic quote - JS
         * Share & Save button - JS


      * Create Footer
         

      * Make Mobile Friendly


   * ### Design Decisions

       * #### User Interface & Interaction
          * For the landing page: 
             I wanted it to hold enough information with less distracting features to appeal to the user who didn't have much time at hand but just wanted to glance at a quote or browse through different inspirational quotes. 

             - Chose 2 main colours for the best contrast ( black for background and green for the quote) and 2 other colours (white to contrast green and purple for additional info)


             Thus the `quick mood booster` (main component to inspire the user) is positioned in the middle of the landing page, The `refresh` and the `info` icons positioned on the top right and bottom right. These positions seems inituitive as to where a user will look for these features upon landing on the page. The `refresh` as it means intituively will change the quote in the middle upon click. 

             The `create` was intentional placed on the bottom left to match the position of the logo and more importantly not to distract the user from the quick mood booster in the middle. The `hand pointing down` seems subtle but was added to indicate to the user that the page will go down if pressed.

             The `info` will show the user information about how to interact with the page upon hover.

            The `logo` was designed specially to match the colors on the landing page and name of the project

          * For make-your-own (create quote) feature:
            I wanted the user to feel that they have a lot of room and options to explore and be creative. 


            The `header `for this section says it all: explore your inner creativity. 

            Thus the reason for creating the `image selection and preview panel`, the `text editor`,the `color picker` for font color.

            A `create button` to see their final button and an option to share and save it. 

            All these goes to make the page flexible and fun. 

            I divided the user experience for this section into the creation and aftermath. 

            For the creation experience, the user will see and interact with the image selection and preview panel, the text area, and the color picker. 

             ![Creativity Page](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/projectOne/images/documentationImages/creativityPage2.png)

            The aftermath of the creation, the user will be taken to a page where the user will see and interact with the `share and save buttons`. 


             <table>
             <tr>
             <td>

             ![Share Page](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/projectOne/images/documentationImages/sharePage.png)

             </td>
             <td>

             ![Download shot](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/projectOne/images/documentationImages/downloadShot.png)

             </td>
             </tr>
            </table>

           
        * It is worth noting that the whole site is a `one page site, scrollable but have buttons to help user jump between sections` make the webpage more flexible and fun to interact with.
