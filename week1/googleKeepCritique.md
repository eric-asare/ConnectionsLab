### Introduction

Google Keep is a note-taking service offered by Google for users to capture and share what’s on their minds wherever they are. Google keep is simple but powerful for quickly accessing and organizing information. 

### Critique
I found Google keep to be an easy-to-use, convenient and effective way to keep notes. At first glance, it looks so simple to be as powerful as it is. The user would not need a  guide to start using the application. 

Google keep is easily accessible since it comes with a google account and can easily be located in the apps icons on the chrome browser or through a simple google search.

I really like the flexibility it gives to the user. I can take notes using text, voice,  photos, and even checklists. I can also change the color of my notes, add images and links. If  I want to print out my notes and hand them in person, I can easily integrate them with Google docs. There is also an option to organize my notes according to labels. It is convenient because of the synchronization with other devices and platforms so easy access from iOs, Android, windows, macOS . It even has an offline feature where you can type notes on your android phone when not connected to the internet and still have access to it. I can easily compile all my ideas and list into one space and easily access them from many devices
I have the option to also share my notes and collaborate in real-time with other users. 

I also love the dark and light theme feature making it easy to write notes both in the day and night without worrying about my eye. 

What I didn’t like about Google keep is the fact that there are no formatting options. I cannot be creative as I want with it. It would be cool if I could hand draw. The notes and organization get a bit messy when you have more notes. There is also a limit to the number of characters and labels I can use.  There is no way to embed links and other files in the notes. It seems it is made for only listing ideas.
