# goStudy Project Documentation 
## Description
I built a webpage to document my personal project - goStudy Chrome Extension.

### WIREFRAME
I began by drawing the wireframe on paper then onto paint. Even though, I developed the website layout to be slightly different from the wireframe, 
I would have spent more time making design decision if I had not already drawn the wireframe.

### HTML
I started the development by translating the wireframe into HTML. 
This was the outcome - ![WebPage-part1](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/week1/goStudyWebPageDocumentation/webpage-part1/goStudyWebPage/index.html)

One hard lesson I learnt from the above step is to fully document my projects since I spent some hours to reread my old code to gather more info about
my project for the webpage. 
### CSS
Styling with CSS was the most challenging part for me. I had to center alot of images and text and couldn't get it right on the first try.
I learned that if I put div around an image, I can center it as using flex. Also, to apply size-changes to images, I had to call the img itself in 
my css file and not the div in which the image is located. Also using percentages instead of fixed sizes made my webpage a bit responsive.
Switching between full screen for the Chrome Dev Tools. On that note, Chrome Dev Tools was really helpful in styling. I could try a lot of styles
and transfer the working styles to my CSS file.
