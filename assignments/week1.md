# goStudy Project Documentation 
## Description
I built a webpage to document my personal project - goStudy Chrome Extension. 

### WIREFRAME
I began by drawing the wireframe on paper then onto paint. Even though, I developed the website layout to be slightly different from the wireframe, 
I would have spent more time making design decision if I had not already drawn the wireframe.

### HTML
I started the development by translating the wireframe into HTML. 
This was the outcome - [WebPage-HTML](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/week1/goStudyWebPageDocumentation/webpage-part1/goStudyWebPage/index.html)

One hard lesson I learnt from the above step is to fully document my projects since I spent some few hours rereading my old code to gather more info about
my project for the webpage. 
### CSS
Styling with CSS was the most challenging part for me. I had to center alot of images and text and couldn't get it right on the first try.
I learned that if I put div around an image, I can center it using flex. Also, to apply size-changes to images, I had to call the image itself in 
my css file and not the div in which the image is located. Also using percentages instead of fixed sizes made my webpage a bit responsive when switching between full screen and the Chrome Dev Tools. On that note, the Chrome Dev Tools was really helpful in styling the page mainly because I could try a lot of styles on the webpage and transfer the working styles to my CSS file. 

### FINAL
Here is the working link to final webpage [WebPage-HTML&CSS](https://eric-asare.github.io/ConnectionsLab/week1/goStudyWebPageDocumentation/webpage-final/goStudyWebPage/index.html)
